##### Sales Data Processing

- Instead of breaking the sales down by store, instead give us a sales breakdown by product category across all of our stores.
- Find the monetary value for the highest individual sale for each separate store.
- Find the total sales value across all the stores, and the total number of sales. Assume there is only one reducer.
